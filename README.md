# PDE Notes

This directory collects notes, experiments, and small implementations related to
partial differential equations (PDEs).

The content is exploratory in nature and may include:
- different solution techniques for the same equation,
- transformations between PDEs,
- reformulations into canonical forms (e.g. heat-type equations),
- analytical observations motivated by applications in physics or finance.

The structure is intentionally flexible and may evolve over time as new material is added.
