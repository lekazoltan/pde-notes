# From Black–Scholes to the Heat Equation

This short note derives the classical transformation that reduces
the Black–Scholes PDE to the standard heat equation via a logarithmic
change of variables and an exponential gauge transform.

The computation is elementary but somewhat technical, so the full
derivation is recorded here in a clean form. The heat kernel representation
then yields an explicit integral formula for the Black–Scholes solution.
