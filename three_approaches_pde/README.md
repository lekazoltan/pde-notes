# three_approaches_pde
Three approaches to solving a linear parabolic PDE: gauge transformation, Feynman–Kac, and Fourier method.

This note presents three complementary approaches to the same linear parabolic PDE:

1. Gauge transformation (analytic view)  
2. Feynman–Kac formula (probabilistic view)  
3. Fourier method (spectral view)

All three methods lead to the same explicit kernel representation, 
illustrating the unity between analysis, probability, and spectral theory.
